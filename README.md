## Project's objectives
Many areas in Indonesia doesnt have efficient and reliable public transportation, its leading people to prefer using private transportation such as four-wheeled vehicles or two-wheeled vehicles. However, this project specifically concentrates on four-wheeled vehicles or cars. In line with the inadequate public transportation in Indonesia, the demand for cars is increasing, and buying and selling used cars has become quite popular for people who need a four-wheeled vehicle but have a limited budget. In this digital era, the online buying and selling of used cars provide sellers to advertise widely through a platform and connects with potential buyers. This project focuses on establishing database for the sale of used cars.Â 
The aim of this article is to design a database system for selling the used cars with well-organized structure.

## Designing The Database
In designing the database, the first step is to determine the mission statement. The mission statement for this project is as follows:
1. Users can advertise used cars.
2. Users can place bids on the advertised cars.

This project has some limitations, including:
1. Each user of the application can advertise more than one product.
2. Every user can search for offered cars based on the seller's location, car brand, and body type.
3. If a potential buyer is interested in a car, they can bid on the product if the seller allows the bidding feature.
4. Purchase transactions are conducted outside the application and are not within the project scope.
